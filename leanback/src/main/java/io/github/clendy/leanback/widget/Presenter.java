/**
 * A Presenter is used to generate {@link View}s and bind Objects to them on
 * demand. It is closely related to the concept of an {@link
 * android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter RecyclerView.Adapter}, but is
 * not position-based.  The leanback framework implements the adapter concept using
 * {@link ObjectAdapter} which refers to a Presenter (or {@link PresenterSelector}) instance.
 *
 * <p>
 * Presenters should be stateless.  Presenters typically extend {@link ViewHolder} to store all
 * necessary view state information, such as references to child views to be used when
 * binding to avoid expensive calls to {@link View#findViewById(int)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A trivial Presenter that takes a string and renders it into a {@link
 * android.widget.TextView TextView}:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * public class StringTextViewPresenter extends Presenter {
 *     // This class does not need a custom ViewHolder, since it does not use
 *     // a complex layout.
 *
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent) {
 *         return new ViewHolder(new TextView(parent.getContext()));
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, Object item) {
 *         String str = (String) item;
 *         TextView textView = (TextView) viewHolder.mView;
 *
 *         textView.setText(item);
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     public void onUnbindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder) {
 *         // Nothing to unbind for TextView, but if this viewHolder had
 *         // allocated bitmaps, they can be released here.
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * In addition to view creation and binding, Presenter allows dynamic interface (facet) to
 * be added: {@link #setFacet(Class, Object)}.  Supported facets:
 * <li> {@link ItemAlignmentFacet} is used by {@link HorizontalGridView} and
 * {@link VerticalGridView} to customize child alignment.
